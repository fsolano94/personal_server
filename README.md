# Personal Server

A simple nodejs server which will be able to connect to a mongo database.

I plan to hold meal plans, workout logs, and any other useful information that can be easily charted, on this server.

## Implemented Features

- Meal plans can be created and stored on the database.

- Meal plans can be pulled up from the database and loaded.

- Workout logs can be created and stored on the database.

- Workout logs can be pulled up from the database and loaded.

## Planned Features

- I would like to implement a clientside MVC Framework, AngularJS or Backbone, at some point in the near future.  This
will really help with keeping my code organized as I move forward.

- At some point, I want to put this code base on Github.  This will not be a hard thing to do, but it is something I will
need to do when I get a chance.

## Planned Improvements

- At some point, I will want to reorganize my serverside socket.io code.  It has become quite messy and already a bit
unmanageable.

- It would be a good idea to use Bootstrap at a later point, too, to improve the UI quality.


## Bugs

- there are no bugs on my radar
